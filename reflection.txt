During the development of this assignment I learned a lot. I wanted to use 
TypeScript as it's been gaining a lot of popularity and want to gain experience
with it. Learning the typing system took more time than I expected but in the
end it was worth it. One thing that was difficult was the chart on the Dashboard
page. To display the revenue correctly it has to go through a calculation
function to get the correct amount. I also learned a lot of the purpose of 
proper planning. Having a good plan and layout for the application makes a lot 
of the development easier later into the process. I already had a good idea of
what I wanted to do and only had to figure out the best way to do it rather than
planning as it goes.

Some future improvements would be adding a Stripe onboarding process. Basically,
if the partner hasn't set up Stripe there would be a banner that lets them know.
From there they could click on a link that would take them to Stripe to set
everything up. As far as other features it would depend on what the partners
want. This is an initial start that then we'll get some feedback from partners
and see what other things they want.

Overall this was a great project that gave me a lot of experience. I was glad
I was able to do it because I feel like it can build my resume a lot.
